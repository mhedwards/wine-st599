Multiclass classification

One-vs-all (one-vs-rest)

response takes on small # of discrete values


treat class "x" as positive class, everything else as negative class
repeat for all classes

fit three classifiers
h_theta ^ i(x) = P(y=i| x; theta); i = 1,2,3...

train logisit regression clasifier h_theta ^ i(x)  for each class i to predict the probability that y=i.


on new pinput x, to make a prediction, pick the class i that maximises max(over i) h_theta ^ i(x)  highest probability, we then predict y to be that value.
