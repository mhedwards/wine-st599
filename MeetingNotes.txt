Regression
 - why is multi-coll not an issue? - when making estiamtes, it tents to blow up your standard errors, but because you're only predicting, you can kind of ignore it.
 
 
 
 
Classification -
how do you do model selection - lambda represnets a specific set of criteria that make a model. Teh cross-validation is anaagus to the AIC, you pick the model with the lowest cross-validation error
Training set error is artificially low.
